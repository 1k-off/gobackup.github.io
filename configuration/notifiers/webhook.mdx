title: Webhook

<Note>Since: 1.5.0</Note>

Webhook is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information.

We will send message to your Webhook URL via HTTP POST method (You can also change it by `method` config), with `Content-Type: application/json`.

```json
{
  "title": "This is title",
  "message": "This is message"
}
```

## Example

```yml
models:
  my_app:
    storages:
      local:
        type: local
        keep: 10
    notifiers:
      webhook:
        type: webhook
        url: http://localhost:3000/api/backup-notifiy.json
        method: POST
        headers:
          Authorization: 'Bearer this-is-token'
```
