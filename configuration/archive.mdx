Archive is packaging files, and directories into a single file `.tar`.

## Config

- `includes` - files, path you want to package.
- `excludes` - you may need to ignore some paths.

## Example

```yml
models:
  my_backup:
    archive:
      includes:
        - /path/to/your/file
        - /path/to/your/directory
      excludes:
        - /path/to/your/directory/ignore
```
