# GoBackup Docker

We builded a Docker image for GoBackup. You can use it to run GoBackup in a container.

## Usage

Create `gobackup.yml` in `./gobackup` folder.

```bash
mkdir gobackup
touch gobackup/gobackup.yml
```

Write config into `gobackup/gobackup.yml`

```yml
web:
  host: 0.0.0.0
models:
  my_app:
    compress_with:
      type: tgz
    storages:
      local:
        type: local
        keep: 20
        path: /root/backups
    databases:
      my_app:
        database: my_app_production
        type: mysql
        host: localhost
        port: 3306
        username: root
```

### Run GoBackup in Docker.

```bash
docker run -d --name gobackup \
  -v $(pwd)/gobackup:/etc/gobackup \
  -v $(pwd)/cycler:/root/.gobackup/cycler \
  -p 2703:2703 \
  huacnlee/gobackup:latest
```

`/root/.gobackup/cycler` needs to be persisted for the cycler to work correctly. If this directory is not
persisted, the cycler will not be able to remove outdated backups after a container restart.

If you want to persist logs as well, instead of `/root/.gobackup/cycler`, you can use `/root/.gobackup` as a volume.

Now can access GoBackup Web UI at http://127.0.0.1:2703.

### Run GoBackup with docker compose.

```yaml
services:
  gobackup:
    image: huacnlee/gobackup:latest
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:2703:2703"
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./gobackup.yml:/etc/gobackup/gobackup.yml
      - ./cycler:/root/.gobackup/cycler
```
