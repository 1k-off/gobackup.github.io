# Storage Overview

GoBackup has built-in multiple storages, you can use one or more storages to store backup file.

Use `storages` config to set storages.

## Example

```yml
models:
  my_app:
    default_storage: s3
    storages:
      local_disk:
        type: local
        path: /data/backups
      s3:
        type: s3
        bucket: my-bucket
        region: us-east-1
        access_key_id: xxx
        secret_access_key: xxx
```

When you set up multiple storages, GoBackup will upload backup file to all storages.

The `default_storage` is optional, for special a storage to Web UI browser, if you don't set it, GoBackup will use the first storage as default.

## Cycling

GoBackup allows you to config how many backups to keep at each storage.

Each Storage supports the `keep` setting, which specifies how many backups to keep at this location.

For example:

```yml
models:
  my_app:
    storages:
      local_disk:
        type: local
        keep: 10
        path: /data/backups
```

**`keep` as a Number**

If `keep` having specified and once the `keep` limit has been reached, the older backup files will be removed.

GoBackup will save the backup histories in `~/.gobackup/cycler.json`.
